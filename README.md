# parking-lot
> CLI project about a parking lot ticketing system.

## Description

* System needs to at least have python 3.7 installed to execute this program
* Because of time concerns, Docker is not implemented
* Also I did not check python condition in system, therefore if there are python version problem, please go to file my_program, and change python3 to 'python', or 'python3.7' as needed

## Execution
* be sure to change permission of file before execution
* Please go to the repository directory and use "$ ./my_program file_inputs.txt > file_output.txt" or "$ ./my_program" to execute with non-interaction mode

##### Thank you for reviewing the project, have great day!!
